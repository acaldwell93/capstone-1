###  Gun Violence events in U.S. 2013-2018

**[https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data](https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data)**

This dataset contains data on five years worth of gun-related incidents in the United States. It contains a number of interesting indicators, including a somewhat fluid ‘incident characteristics’ indicator that could be used to group/analyze/compare the different incidents, things like drug involvement, co-occurrence with other crimes, previous criminal history. This would help answer questions like whether there any characteristics that reliably predict higher chances or deadliness of a gun-related event, who are the most common victims of this violence, etc. This could possibly combine well with geographic heatmaps to see concentrations of events and where events with similar characteristics occurred.

### New York City Property Sales

This data set shows record of every property sold in New York City over a 12 month Sept 2016- Sept 2017. It relatively detailed information on location details like borough, neighborhood, address and further details on square footage, sale price, age of the building, and building class. I'd like to compare how sales prices differ according to borough/neighborhood/address. Certain neighborhoods are, of course, more expensive than others, but do some neighborhoods pay a higher premium for certain things like elevator access vs. walkup. How does the age of a building factor into space and cost depending on the neighborhood? Map visualizations might be cool here, as well.


### Report Card database from NYSDE

**[https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php](https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php)**

The Report Card database from the New York State Department of Education website could be interesting to look at. Its overall purpose is to record educational data that can be used to track school accountability/progress. Most interestingly, it includes a good deal of specific school and staff indicators, like teacher experience and qualifications, as well as measures of success like graduation rates and accountability status. I’d like to explore what indicators seem to have the greatest impact on a school’s measures of success.
