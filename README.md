### Challenges with munging the data:

#### 1. Parsing out the data contained in 'dictionary strings'
Some of the columns contained data in the form of strings that were written in a key-value pair format. Parsing this data out was crucial to being able to understand the demographics of the incident. Once you can identify who was involved and in what capacity, you could then determine a demographic breakdown(age, gender, outcome). Parsing was made more difficult by some inconsistencies in how the string was formatted.
